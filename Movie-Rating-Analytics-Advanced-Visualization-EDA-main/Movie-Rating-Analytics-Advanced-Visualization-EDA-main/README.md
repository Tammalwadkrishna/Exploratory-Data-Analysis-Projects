# 🎬 Movie Rating Analytics — Advanced Visualization & EDA

## 📖 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **advanced visualizations** on a movie ratings dataset.  
It aims to uncover insights about movie popularity, user ratings, and trends using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

## 🧩 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw movie rating data  
- Exploratory analysis to find rating distributions and correlations  
- Advanced data visualization for pattern discovery  
- Insights into viewer preferences and movie trends  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - plotly (if used for interactive charts)

## 📂 Dataset
The notebook uses a CSV file named:
```
Movie-Rating.csv
```
You can replace this file with your own dataset in the same structure (movie titles, genres, ratings, etc.).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed.  
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```
4. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MOVEI.ipynb
   ```
5. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## 📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes:
- Distribution of movie ratings  
- Genre-wise average ratings  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Boxplots and histograms for data comparison  
- (Optional) Interactive visualizations with Plotly  

## 💡 Insights
Some expected findings (depending on your data):
- Popular genres among high-rated movies  
- Relationship between rating count and average rating  
- Trends or biases in movie rating distributions  

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Implement a simple recommendation engine  
- Add interactivity with Dash or Streamlit  
- Integrate with live movie databases (TMDB API, IMDB datasets)
